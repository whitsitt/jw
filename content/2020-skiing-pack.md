I went on a short weekend ski trip to Park City, UT. I don't have a photo of my items, but if you have seen my North Face Recon backpack, it was completely stuffed. Zippers were hard to close and it barely fit under the seat on the plane. Packing the items in a particular order was the element of success.

**Post travel thoughts**

Thankfully, the weather was great so I didn't wear the under armour shirt, the baklava or need the long underwear and everything dried out quickly after use. I don't think the clothes got too bad but you may have to ask my travel mates. Not having gone skiing in a long time, I didn't realize how sweaty I would get, so if I was to do it again, I would leave those items out in favor of another tee.

Also, I made a last minute, untested decsision to leave my primary phone charger and adapter at home and just use a short cord that works with my battery bank's wall adapter. **Big mistake**. The cord was too short for airport charging spots and the USB-C would not stay connected to my phone. To charge, I had to connect my battery bank and hold it in my hand with my phone to keep the cord from disconnecting. Charging was slow and painful.

I also regret not taking my packable backpack or my collapsible water bottle. Both of those along with some snacks inside would be great during skiing. I saw a lot of people saving a LOT of money by not succumbing to the high-prices at the mid-mountain lodges.

I thought the coffee mug was a good idea even though it took up a lot of space. I could fill it with water at the airport and it helped me reduce waste. Unfortuantely, the opportunity to grab coffee before skiing was when we were already suited up. Without a backpack, I had no where to put the mug after drinking while skiing. 

I saw a lot of people flying in to Salt Lake City with skis, boots and helmets. I am sure if you go a lot, there is a benefit to doing that, but rentals seemed reasonable and convienent.
