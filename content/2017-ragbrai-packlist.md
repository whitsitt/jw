I have been on RAGBRAI (Des Moines Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa) several times since 2005. Over the years, I'd like to think I have figured out a pretty good list of gear. In general, this list is usually what I start with when planning a bicycle touring trip, not just for RAGBRAI.

An asterisk denotes a "luxury" item that I only take when riding supported (team bus). Otherwise, everything can pack on the bike (except the bike itself of course).

For food and drink, we mostly rely on stops along the way. However, included is some supplemental nutrition to keep the spending under control.

Depending on the route, I either ride my Surly Long Haul Trucker (35c tires) or my Single Speed Cyclocross bike (23c tires, 46:17).

[^1]: my SS bike only has one cage, so I carry a collapsible bottle in my jersey pocket.
[^2]: this adapter is helpful to fill tires in car dominated nation.
[^3]: a garbage bag is a poor man's rain jacket. you are going to get wet on the bike, but this will keep your core warm.
[^4]: if the weather looks overly hot and i have the space, a camp fan really makes a difference.
[^5]: poor man's dry bags/luggage organizers.
[^6]: padding for your bike frame while on the bus.
[^7]: helpful to adjust wheels if i bring the single speed.
