Going into Labor Day weekend, Abby and I traveled to New York City to attend my buddy's wedding as well as celebrate our 10-year wedding anniversary.

All in all, with travel to/from, we spent 5 nights, went carry-on only and had a wide range of events dictating dress code. Weather sunny in the high 80s. Urban sightseeing, broadway theatre, casual to fancy dining, a formal wedding and Ultimate Frisbee in Central Park.

**Wearing on the plane**:

Easter color dress shirt, belt, jeans, grey underwear, socks, dress shoes, hat.

**Post-travel notes**:

* Didn't wear dark grey tee (checker dress shirt was worn multiple days)
* Only rinsed running shorts
* Barefoot shoes were not made for urban exploring. The pack nice, but miles of walking city streets made my feet hurt. Experienced this in Dublin too but forgot. Also I was lucky not to pierce my shoe with a construction nail, glass etc.
* Dress shoes made going through TSA inefficient.
* Bag fit nicely under seats.
* Wore instead of packed suit jacket for trip home.
* Saw men bring suit bags as a personal item.
* Wrinkles weren't too bad overall. Ironed white dress shirt before wedding.
* Vest was hot for wedding and I felt overdressed.
* Bought wireless Bluetooth headphones for trip home.
* Could have survived with just grey pants instead of also jeans.
* Bought additional suncreen. Didn't use either...
